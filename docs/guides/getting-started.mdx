# Getting Started

> **Note:** FAB v1 is in _public pre-release_. Things will change, but [any feedback](/guides/feedback) you can give is greatly appreciated.

FABs are a [special zip file](/kb/fab-structure) that contains a complete snapshot of your application: all your server-side code, all your client-side assets, and it can be deployed [anywhere that runs JS](/guides/deploying).

## Installing

```
yarn global add @fab/cli
npm install -g @fab/cli
```

> **Note:** in the future, you will not need to do this, instead you can use `npx fab` and `yarn dlx fab` to do everything without global installation. But [not yet](https://github.com/fab-spec/fab/issues/71).

## `fab init`

You can configure a repository to build a FAB by running `fab init` in the repo:

```sh
fab init -y
```

> **Note:** `-y` means "accept all prompts". It's mandatory right now because [I haven't built prompting yet ðŸ˜³](https://github.com/fab-spec/fab/issues/73)

The following frameworks are supported:

* Create React App
* NextJS 9+

## `fab build`

`fab init` will add `build:fab` and `fab:build` scripts to your `package.json`, but both of them call `fab build` under the hood.

```sh
# runs npm run build, then builds the FAB
yarn build:fab
npm run build:fab

# alias for fab build, below
yarn fab:build
npm run fab:build

# generates a FAB according to your fab.config.json5
fab build
```

If it works, you should get a `fab.zip` file output.

## `fab serve`

```sh
fab serve fab.zip
fab serve fab.zip --port=3001
```

Runs your FAB in a local NodeJS Express server.

## `fab deploy`

Will prompt you for your Cloudflare workers & Amazon S3 info and deploy your FAB!
