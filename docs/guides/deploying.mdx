# Deploying FABs

## "Anywhere that can run JS"

Because FABs are pure JavaScript, not NodeJS, they have no dependencies on a filesystem or any other operating-system-level APIs (which is why they can be a bit complex to build!), but it means they're portable in a totally new way.

This means they can be deployed to:

* Cloudflare Workers
* Amazon Lambda/Lambda@Edge
* Now.sh
* Heroku
* Any other "serverless" platform
* Anywhere that can run Docker
* Anywhere that can run NodeJS

But they cannot be deployed to popular static hosts like:

* Amazon S3
* Netlify*

> \* Netlify is technically possible, but currently untested & performance may not be acceptable.

## Implementation status

| Platform  | Proof-of-concept | [Linc.sh](https://linc.sh) deployer  | Open-source |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Cloudflare Workers  | ✅  | ✅  | ✅  |
| Amazon Lambda@Edge  | ✅  | ✅  | ❌  |
| Amazon Lambda  | ✅  | ❌  | ❌  |
| Now.sh  | ✅  | ❌  | ❌  |
| Heroku  | ✅  | ❌  | ❌  |
| Docker  | ✅  | ❌  | ❌  |

At the moment, most focus has been on targeting [Cloudflare workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) as they're the most restrictive (i.e. if it works there, it'll work anywhere), but also extremely highly-performant at a low cost. For some platforms, [Linc](https://linc.sh), the FAB-native CI/CD+ pipeline & the primary sponsor of FAB development, can write a custom releaser for the platforms that their customers are using, which will then make their way to a full open-source release.
