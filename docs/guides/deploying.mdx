# Deploying FABs

There are two ways to deploy FABs:

* **Manually**, by adding a `deploy` section to your `fab.config.json5` and calling `fab deploy fab.zip` on the command line.
* **Automatically**, by using a cloud-based service such as [Linc](https://linc.sh).

## Assets vs Server hosting

FABs are [a combination of a server file and an assets directory](/kb/fab-structure), and while some hosts (like the NodeJS-based `@fab/server`) are capable of serving both, in practice it can be advantageous to have the stored separately.

For instance, you typically only have one "version" of your FAB deployed at once, i.e. one `server.js` file online at any one time, but assets from old releases may still need to be accessed. Also, since assets are guaranteed to be fingerprinted they can, and are, served with `cache-control: immutable`, meaning that they're readily cached at the edge using a CDN, meaning that the performance requirements of the hosting service itself is quite different.

With that in mind, these are the currently-supported hosting platforms:

## AWS S3

AWS S3 is a perfect choice for your asset hosts, since it's virtually unlimited and extremely cost-effective, and can be set up for public, read-only access, with the FAB server sitting in front of it.

> ðŸ‘‰ In fact, S3 is so good it's currently the _only_ asset hosting option, until [this issue](https://github.com/fab-spec/fab/pull/113) is resolved to use Cloudflare KV store for assets.
