# Plugins

What makes FAB plugins different to other JS web tooling is that **plugins can be invoked during _both_ compile time & at runtime**. What this means is that a plugin can read/manipulate a FAB as it's being constructed, and _also_ inject the server-side code needed.

## Runtime-only vs Build-time-and-runtime plugins

A plugin can be as simple as a single-file, but in that case it _can only have a runtime component_ (see the [Adding Server-Side Logic](/guides/adding-server-side-logic) guide for simple examples). Runtime-only plugins cover a lot of the small, project-specific customisations you'll need: adding proxying, redirects, checking cookies, setting headers, that sort of thing.

For plugins that affect _both_ the build phase and runtime phase of a FAB build, two files are needed: a `build.js` (or `.ts`) and `runtime.js` (or `.ts`). See the [Plugin Resolution](#plugin-resolution) and [Using Typescript](#using-typescript) sections below for the specifics.

Two separate files are required because they're executed in very different ways:

* `build` is called by the `@fab/cli`, so has access to the full NodeJS ecosystem of tools, and direct access to the filesystem, and can use CLI utilities like `log`, `prompt` or `confirm`. This file needs to be in a format interpretable by your current NodeJS version
* `runtime` is **compiled into the FAB itself** using Rollup. This means it, and its dependencies, _need to be compatible with the [FAB Runtime Environment](/kb/fab-runtime-environment)_, so 


## Build-time example: Generating 301 redirects for old blog URLs



```js
// server/old-blog-url-format.js

export const build = async (args, proto_fab) => {
  // Attach an object to proto_fab.metadata, which is serialised
  // and passed to your runtime as the second argument
  proto_fab.metadata.blog_rewrites = {}

  for (const filename of proto_fab.files.keys()) {
    // Look for anything looking like /blog/123-new-post-format
    const new_blog_format = filename.match(/^\/blog\/(\d+)/)
    if (new_blog_format) {
      const blog_id = new_blog_format[1]
      // Make a record that this `blog_id` now lives at `filename`
      proto_fab.metadata.blog_rewrites[blog_id] = filename
    }
  }
}

export const runtime = (args, metadata) => {
  // Runtime functions are synchronous in order to perform any
  // setup needed.
  const { blog_rewrites } = metadata

  // They return an async function that can intervene on any request
  return async ({ request, settings, url }) => {
    // Only respond on request for the old URL pattern /articles/123
    const old_blog_format = url.pathname.match(/^\/articles\/(\d+)/)
    if (!old_blog_format) return

    // Same as before, pull the `blog_id` off the URL
    const blog_id = old_blog_format[1]
    const new_blog_url = blog_rewrites[blog_id]
    if (!new_blog_url) {
      // If that `blog_id` doesn't exist, return a 404
      return new Response(null, { status: 404 })
    } else {
      // Otherwise return a 301 Moved Permanently
      return new Response(null, {
        status: 301,
        headers: {
          Location: new_blog_url,
        },
      })
    }
  }
}
```

## Plugin resolution

We handle (read: hide from the user) this complexity by allowing a single plugin entry to represent both, while keeping the files separate. For example, for a plugin config like:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    '@fab/some-plugin': {
      /* ... */
    },
  },
}
```

We first look to resolve `@fab/some-plugin/runtime` and `@fab/some-plugin/build`, which are then required and integrated at the relevant stage (and assumed to only export their respective functions). If _neither_ of those files exist, we require `@fab/some-plugin` and look for `build` and `runtime` in its exports.

Note: most `@fab/xxx` plugins do not have a `main` entry in their `package.json` file, meaning they cannot be required without adding `/build` or `/runtime`. It's a bit weird, but it's the best I could come up with!

Also note: this works the same with relative path plugins, like `./src/fab-server`:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    './src/fab-server': {
      /* ... */
    },
  },
}
```

This will "just work" if `src/fab-server` is a directory with `build.js` and/or `runtime.js` inside it, or if it is a file `src/fab-server.js` that exports `build` or `runtime` functions.

You can also be more explicit if you like:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    './src/fab-server/build': {
      /* ... */
    },
    './src/fab-server/runtime': {
      /* ... */
    },
  },
}
```

## Using Typescript

The FAB project is 100% Typescript, so we support defining your plugins in Typescript as well. In the above examples, anywhere `.js` is referenced, a `.ts` file should work as well.

Note: we don't [currently](https://github.com/fab-spec/fab/issues/65) do any typechecking during build, that's up to you. Usually IDE integration is enough to guide you for simple plugins, anything more complex probably needs its own toolchain anyway.

Relevant types can be imported from `@fab/core`:

```ts
import {
  ProtoFab,
  PluginArgs,
  PluginMetadataContent,
  FabBuildStep,
  FabPluginRuntime,
  PluginMetadata,
  FabSettings,
} from '@fab/core'

interface MyPluginArgs extends PluginArgs {
  'any-args'?: number
  'you-want'?: RegExp
  'from-config'?: string
}

interface MyPluginMetadata extends PluginMetadata {
  my_plugin_name: {
    my_metadata_object: {
      // Define what you want to pass from build to runtime
    }
  }
}

export const build: FabBuildStep = async (
  args: MyPluginArgs,
  proto_fab: ProtoFab<MyPluginMetadata>
) => {
  // Make changes to proto_fab
}

export const runtime: FabPluginRuntime = (
  args: MyPluginArgs,
  metadata: MyPluginMetadata
) => {
  const { my_metadata_object } = metadata.my_plugin_name

  return async ({
    request,
    settings,
    url,
  }: {
    request: Request
    settings: FabSettings
    url: URL
  }) => {
    // Return undefined to skip plugin, a Response to respond,
    // or a Directive for more advanced behaviour
  }
}
```

## Restrictions

At the moment, the plugin loading system isn't as sophisticated as we'd like it to be. These issues track our progress towards each of them. If there's anything else you're interested in proposing [raise an issue](https://github.com/fab-spec/fab/issues/new).

- [Plugins that use ES Modules or Typescript syntax can't be used for the `build` step](https://github.com/fab-spec/fab/issues/66)
- [Typescript plugins aren't typechecked](https://github.com/fab-spec/fab/issues/65)
- [Runtime plugins aren't checked for validity before being passed to the Compiler](https://github.com/fab-spec/fab/issues/67)


For a given entry in the `plugins` key of your `fab.config.json5` file, e.g.

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    './some-local-file': {/*...*/},
    '@some-org/package-name': {/*...*/},
  }
}
```

The FAB compiler will attempt to resolve `'./some-local-file` _relative to the location of the `fab.config.json5`, then look for `./some-local-file/runtime` if that's not found. The same happens with the NPM package: first `'@some-org/package-name'` is attempted, then `

Though you _can_ use a single file to export both a `build` and `runtime` export, for anything more sophisticated you're going to want to have separate files. This is because the two commands run at different times, in quite different environments. `build` is called by the CLI, so has access to the full NodeJS ecosystem of tools, and direct access to the filesystem. `runtime`, on the other hand, is **compiled into the FAB itself**. This means it, and its dependencies, _need to be compatible with the [FAB Runtime Environment](/kb/fab-runtime-environment)_, which is pure JS, no NodeJS at all.
