# Configuration

FAB builds use a `fab.config.json5` file:

```json5
// fab.config.json5
{
  plugins: {
    '@fab/input-static': {
      dir: 'dist', // Read files from this directory
    },
    '@fab/serve-html': {
      // Enrich HTML files with:
      injections: {
        env: {
          name: 'FAB_SETTINGS', // which global variable to use?
        },
        csp: {
          nonce: true,
        },
      },
    },
    '@fab/rewire-assets': {},
  },
  settings: {
    production: './production-settings.json',
    staging: {
      API_URL: 'https://staging.lol.com',
    },
  },
}
```

## Value types

This file is [JSON5](https://json5.org/), a superset of JSON that's closer to normal JS syntax (i.e. it has comments and unquoted keys). A normal JSON file is valid JSON5, though, if you prefer that, and support for other formats like YAML is [planned](https://github.com/fab-spec/fab/issues/39).

We deviate in one important respect, however, which is that string values of the form `"/regexp/i" are parsed using [regex-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/regex-parser).
