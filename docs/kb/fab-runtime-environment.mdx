# FAB Runtime Environment

When a FAB is being executed, it is running in a `V8::Isolate` container, with the following global variables:

```js
global = {
  fetch: fetch,
  Request: fetch.Request,
  Response: fetch.Response,
  Headers: fetch.Headers,
  URL: URL,
  console: {
    log: console.log,
    error: console.error,
  },
  NODE_ENV: 'server',
  process: {
    env: {
      NODE_ENV: 'server',
    },
  },
  setTimeout,
  setImmediate,
  clearTimeout,
}
```

As a result, any packages that expect NodeJS to be present need to be appropriately shimmed out. This is still a work in progress, thankfully a significant proportion of modern frontend applications are already supported as [one of the known frameworks](https://fab.dev/guides/known-project-types).

## More reading

Since Cloudflare Workers share the same `V8::Isolate` runtime architecture, there is some more information [on their documentation pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/about/how-it-works/), while we work on improving the information here.
