# Cache layer

A FAB uses a totally [stateless request-response model](https://acloud.guru/forums/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/discussion/-KIbOMbOWAdrGAHG0xFh/stateful-stateless-web-service?answer=-KIbiH9anmti9bwC3TDK), but the hosts that execute them often have a way to preserve state between requests. Rather than leave this up to the runtime, FABs provide a `Cache` object on the runtime to permit access to this storage (if it exists):

```ts[counter.js]
import { FABRuntime } from '@fab/core'

export default ({ Router, Cache }: FABRuntime) => {
  Router.on('/cache-test', async () => {
    const n = (await Cache.getNumber('cache-test')) || 0
    await Cache.set('cache-test', n + 1)
    return new Response(`This page has been called ${n + 1} times.\n`)
  })
}
```

## Type definition

```ts[types.ts]
export type FabCache = {
  set: (key: string, value: FabCacheValue, ttl_seconds?: number) => Promise<void>
  setJSON: (key: string, value: any, ttl_seconds?: number) => Promise<void>
  get: (key: string) => Promise<string | undefined>
  getJSON: (key: string) => Promise<any | undefined>
  getNumber: (key: string) => Promise<number | undefined>
  getArrayBuffer: (key: string) => Promise<ArrayBuffer | undefined>
  getStream: (key: string) => Promise<ReadableStream | undefined>
}
```

## No-op implementation

Each FAB ships with a no-op implementation in case the server doesn't provide one:

```ts[no-op-cache.ts]
class NoopCache implements FabCache {
  set = async () => {}
  setJSON = async () => {}
  get = async () => undefined
  getJSON = async () => undefined
  getArrayBuffer = async () => undefined
  getNumber = async () => undefined
  getStream = async () => undefined
}
```

This means that code that correctly uses the `Cache` will run successfully on a host that doesn't provide one, it'll behave as if the Cache is permanently empty. In the above example, the page will always return:

```
This page has been called 1 times.
```

## `@fab/server` implementation

`@fab/server` (which forms the basis of all NodeJS hosting implementations), uses [a very simple in-memory cache](https://github.com/fab-spec/fab/blob/master/packages/server/src/cache.ts). This means changes are _instantly visible_ to all other requests, but _only on the same FAB runtime_ (i.e. same process on the same host).

## AWS Lambda@Edge implementation

This uses [very similar code](https://github.com/fab-spec/fab/blob/master/packages/deployer-aws-lambda/templates/index.js#L30) as `@fab/server` (with the caveat that streams are simplified, since there is no streaming on AWS Lambda@Edge). Each concurrent Lambda keeps an in-memory cache, so subsequent requests will have access to the data _but parallel requests will not_.

> ðŸ‘‰ Note: adding [Elasticache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) (which is Redis/Memcached and would be ideal for this purpose) to the FAB AWS Lambda releaser is an [open issue](https://github.com/fab-spec/fab/issues/208) on the FAB project.

## Cloudflare KV Store implementation

FABs running on Cloudflare are _truly stateless_, so no in-memory caching is possible. However, their [KV Store](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/storage) is a global key-value store, with a spookily [similar API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/apis/kv), making [the FAB implementation](https://github.com/fab-spec/fab/blob/master/packages/deployer-cf-workers/templates/index.js#L39) quite minimal:

```js
class Cache {
  async set(key, value, ttl_seconds) {
    KV_FAB_CACHE.put(key, value, ttl_seconds ? { expirationTtl: ttl_seconds } : undefined)
  }
  async setJSON(key, value, ttl_seconds) {
    await this.set(key, JSON.stringify(value), ttl_seconds)
  }
  async get(key) {
    return KV_FAB_CACHE.get(key)
  }
  async getJSON(key) {
    return KV_FAB_CACHE.get(key, 'json')
  }
  async getArrayBuffer(key) {
    return KV_FAB_CACHE.get(key, 'arrayBuffer')
  }
  async getNumber(key) {
    return KV_FAB_CACHE.get(key, 'json')
  }
  async getStream(key) {
    return KV_FAB_CACHE.get(key, 'stream')
  }
}
```

> ðŸ‘‰ Note: the KV storage is a paid feature on Cloudflare. You will need to use their \$5/month plan to get access to it. If your account does not have KV access, or if you're deploying with an API token that has no KV store privileges, _you will fall back to the No-op Cache_.

### Performance

The KV store is eventually consistent, and globally replicated, so it can take >1s for values to be read after reading. That said, _all FABs running worldwide share a Cache_, which makes different use-cases possible.

There is also a hot/cold aspect to KV keys, where recently-updated keys are quicker to update again.

You can test the simple counter code from above at the following URL: https://next.fab.dev/cache-test

Running a simple command-line tool, we can see how long it takes for the KV-backed Cache to update:

As you can see, write/read performance can be variable, but it's still extremely useful to have a shared, global `Cache` object for edge-rendering.
