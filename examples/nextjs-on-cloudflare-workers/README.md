# NextJS on Cloudflare Workers with FABs

The [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) project is one of the most comprehensive frameworks for writing React apps, and supports applications with multiple degrees of server-side capabilities:

- Fully client-rendered (single-page app runs in the browser)
- Pre-rendered (static HTML generated at build time)
- Server-side rendered (HTML dynamically generated at runtime)

All of these are supported by current FAB toolchain (in fact, a single application can contain all three!), see [fab.dev/guides/getting-started](https://fab.dev/guides/getting-started) for instructions about how to set it up.
