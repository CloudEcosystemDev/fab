   Deployment artifact & hosting runtime for frontend applications

Abstract

   This document describes a format to package up any browser based
   application, regardless of patterns, framework or toolkit so that it
   can run in any hosting environment that confirms to the hosting
   specification.
   It is aiming to achieve for frontends what Docker did for backends.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all

1. Introduction
   
   Frontend applications (Applications running in a browser and often
   connecting to one or backends via APIs) are gaining popularity,
   leading to an explosion of practices, libraries, frameworks and 
   toolkits.
   And at the same time the options for hosting have ballooned as well.
   
   Not too long ago the two main options were either static hosting or
   running your own servers, possibly on an Infrastructure as a Service
   solution (IaaS).
   But now we have an entire range of options ranging from static
   hosting, through serverless (edge) hosting, Platforms as a Service
   and IaaS.

   Frontend Application Bundle is a specification which both describes a
   deployment artifact and a hosting runtime. So that any frontend 
   application can be run in any server that is implements the hosting
   runtime.
   
   In short, FAB is aiming to be the lingua franca between code on
   one end and the hosting infra on the other.

   The hope is that this will allow us to build the next level of
   abstractions on top, just like it happened with Docker.

1.1  Terminology

   Frontend Application: An application that runs inside the browser and
   may optionally connect to one or more backends for data and business
   logic.


2.  Anatomy of a frontend application

   Any frontend application consists of two parts: a Server and Client
   Side Assets.

2.1  Server

   The Server is the part of the application to responds to HTTP
   requests. At a bare minimum the only thing it does is serve the
   Client Side Assets.

   But it may do a lot more, including, but not limited to, generating
   HTML pages and other assets on the fly.

   In many frontend applications, the server is a regular static file
   hosting service that serves a static HTML file.

2.2  Client Side Assets

   The Client Side Assets are the files that contain the code and other
   assets that run inside the browser such as Javascript or CSS files
   images or configuration.


3.  Design considerations & constraints

   The design of the FAB specification is driven by a list of qualities
   that we strive for in particular order. Whenever we need to make a
   trade-off, the higher ordered quality weighs more heavily than lower
   ordered qualities.
   Implementors of the specification SHOULD follow the same list of
   qualities when considering trade-offs.
   
   3.1.  Availability & Reliability

   As FABs will be used by applications in production, it is
   vital that reliability is our absolute top priority.
   We MUST always strive to optimise for the availability of
   applications. This implies a few other related qualities, such as
   security, predictability, resilience and ability to recover from
   errors.

   It is this reliability that will generate trust in the ecosystem and
   our deploys, allowing application developers to release more often.
   This will generate a virtuous cycle of more frequent, less risky
   releases.

   There MUST NOT be any downtime for regular deploys.

   Most importantly, the functional behaviour of an application MUST
   be the same when run in different hosting environments with the same
   settings.
   A hosting environment MAY have different performance characteristics
   and other optimisations.

   3.2.  Compatibility

   Because the purpose of Frontend Application bundles is to provide
   a standard for packaging frontend applications and the runtime 
   environment they run in, it is important that it is compatible with
   as many different applications and hosting providers.

   3.2.1.  Application compatibility

   There are many different patterns, frameworks and practices when it
   comes to frontend applications. Broadly speaking there are three 
   patterns: "Pre-rendering", "Client-Side Rendering" (CSR) and
   "Server-Side Rendering" (SSR).
   And while we should always strive to support as wide a variety of
   applications, we should optimise for the more dynamic ones, such as 
   SSR and CSR.

   And while we see great promise in non-Javascript languages on the
   browser platform (particularly WebAssembly), we will not be
   officially supporting it. Especially not for the server.

   3.2.2.  Hosting compatibility

   For FABs to be successful it needs to not only support a large amount
   of applications, but also hosting providers.
   
   The requirements for a hosting provider should be as low as possible.
   It should run on serverless (edge) hosting platforms, but also on
   large distributed hosting clusters.

   It must be possible to deploy the static assets and the server 
   components to two seperate and specialised systems.

   And lastly it should be possible to host FABs on hosting providers
   that do not yet support FABs natively, so that the FAB community can
   create adapters/wrappers for that particular hosting runtime.

   3.2.3.  Advanced use-cases

   A lot of advanced use-cases for FABs (blue/green deployments, canary
   releases & A/B testing to name just a few) rely on the ability to run
   multiple bundles in production concurrently. Either different
   applications or different versions of the same application.
   
   Not every hosting provider must support these use-cases, but
   decisions must not be made that make this impossible.

   3.3.  Performance

   Performance is critical for a lot of applications. So hosting
   runtimes SHOULD automatically optimise as much as possible. And
   both framework and application developers SHOULD be able to 
   easily customise the behaviour of the server component to improve the
   performance of the application.

   3.4.  Developer Experience

   No software ecosystem thrives without a focus on the experience of
   the developers using it. We recognise 3 different types of
   developers, each with different skills and objectives.

   3.4.1.  Application developers

   Application developers are the developers working on the frontend
   application that will be used by end users.
   
   The experience they have with FABs are the most important one to
   consider. Both because there are many more of them than both
   framework and hosting runtime developers, but also because they have
   less experience and knowledge when it comes to writing reliable and
   performant applications to be able to make the right trade-off.

   A lot of these developers may not even know they are using FABs.

   3.4.2.  Application framework developers

   Application framework developers are the people working on the
   building blocks that are used by the Application Developers to
   create their applications. It is these application frameworks that
   may have logic to output a FAB as a deployment artefact.

   By making it easy to output a FAB it will lower the bar for different
   frameworks to support it natively.

   3.4.3.  Hosting Provider developers

   These are the developers working on the hosting runtimes. Their
   experience isn't about making it easier, but to allow them to build
   the best possible runtime that their hosting platform will allow
   them to build.


4.  Frontend Application Bundle format

   A FAB is a regular zip file which mirrors the two components of a 
   frontend application. It includes a director called '_assets', which
   includes all the static assets that are used by the application and
   a file called 'server.js' that handles all server logic.

   -- server.js
    |
    - _assets - main.abcd1234.js
              |
              - main.bcdef567.css

   4.1  Static Assets
   
   The '_assets' directory contains all static assets for the
   application such as client side Javascript and CSS files, images,
   configuration files or templates or any other content isn't
   dynamically generated.

   Because these files will be cached for a very long time in Content
   Delivery Networks, intermediate proxies and client browsers, it is
   RECOMMENDED that the filename includes a unique fingerprint based on
   the content of the file such as (a part of) a hash of the contents.
   
   4.1.1  URL pathname

   Hosting runtimes MUST make the files available on the '/_assets/' 
   URL pathname for external HTTP clients.

   4.1.2  Caching behaviour

   To improve the performance of the frontend application, all files
   served at the '/_assets/` URL pathname prefix MUST be served with the
   following header:

      Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
